HorseStats
==========

A Bukkit plugin allowing players to see horse statistics. It also has many features that make horses more manageable.

Woo my first repository! I'm still figuring things out so please forgive me if something is messed up.

A few things I want to address:
-I have not put in comments; you might have a hard time following things
-I am fairly new to coding and have taught myself everything I know. If my code looks 
 "unconventional" or "different", it is because I have never learned of such conventions.

Want the plugin? Head on over to BukkitDev! http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/horsestats/
