HorseStats
==========

A Bukkit plugin allowing players to see horse statistics. It also has many features that make horses more manageable.

Woo my first repository! I'm still figuring things out so please forgive me if something is messed up.

A few things I want to address:

-This repo will be updated throughout development. There are changes in the code that are not included in a version
 release.

-I have put in some comments; the main classes have them, but command classes do not.

-I am fairly new to coding and have taught myself everything I know. If my code looks 
 "unconventional" or "different", it is because I have never learned of such conventions.

Want the plugin? Head on over to BukkitDev! http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/horsestats/
